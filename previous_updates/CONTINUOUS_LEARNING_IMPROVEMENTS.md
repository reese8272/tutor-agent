# Continuous Learning Flow Improvements

## 🎯 **Major Changes Made:**

### 1. **Restructured Main Loop** ✅
**Before**: 
- Asked "What do you want to learn?" after every question sequence
- Interrupted learning flow to go back to topic selection
- No continuous conversation

**After**:
- Ask topic and mode ONCE at the beginning
- Continuous learning session until user says "stop", "exit", or "quit"
- Maintains context throughout the entire session
- Natural conversation flow

### 2. **Enhanced Learning Continuity** ✅
**New Features**:
- Single learning session per topic
- User can type "stop", "exit", or "quit" at any time to end
- Optional pause between questions: "Ready for the next question?"
- Maintains all context and previous answers throughout

### 3. **Improved Feedback for Partial Correctness** ✅
**Enhanced Prompt**:
- Added "You're on the right track!" for partial correctness
- Emphasis on building knowledge progressively
- Focus on learning continuity
- Better recognition of partial understanding

**Updated Detection**:
- Recognizes "You're on the right track!" as positive feedback
- More encouragement for learning progression

### 4. **Better User Experience** ✅
**Improvements**:
- Clear session start/end messages
- Better progress indicators
- More natural conversation flow
- Helpful context when students struggle
- Graceful session termination

## 🚀 **New Flow:**

```
1. "What do you want to learn today?" → (ONCE)
2. "Choose mode (learn/review):" → (ONCE)
3. Start continuous learning session
4. Question 1 → Answer → Feedback → Build on understanding
5. Question 2 → Answer → Feedback → Continue building
6. Question 3 → Answer → Feedback → Deepen knowledge
7. ... (continues until user says "stop" or all questions done)
8. Session complete with suggestions
```

## 🎓 **Benefits:**

- ✅ **No interruptions**: Learn continuously on one topic
- ✅ **Context preserved**: Builds on previous answers and understanding  
- ✅ **Natural flow**: Like a real tutoring conversation
- ✅ **Flexible control**: Stop anytime with "stop", "exit", "quit"
- ✅ **Progressive learning**: Each question builds on the last
- ✅ **Encouraging feedback**: Recognizes partial correctness and builds on it
