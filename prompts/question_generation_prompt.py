"""Prompt used when generating new questions from documentation."""

# The prompt is represented as a list of (role, content) tuples. It instructs
# the model to produce two conceptual questions and one coding challenge based
# directly on the provided documentation context. The ``{{context}}`` variable
# will be replaced with the combined text of the retrieved documentation
# chunks.
