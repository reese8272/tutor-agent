# Tutor Agent Testing and Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Review Mode Async Error ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: `object str can't be used in 'await' expression` error in review mode
**Root Cause**: Incorrect use of LangChain LCEL (LangChain Expression Language) chain syntax
**Solution**: 
- Updated `agents/nodes/review_node.py` to use direct `ainvoke()` call on ChatOpenAI instead of chain with StrOutputParser
- Changed from `chain = prompt | ChatOpenAI(...) | StrOutputParser()` to direct prompt formatting and LLM invocation

### 2. Duplicate Question Generation ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: System was repeatedly asking the same questions, not checking previous question history
**Root Cause**: Question generation node wasn't checking against previously asked questions
**Solution**:
- Updated `agents/nodes/generate_questions.py` to load and check question log
- Added logic to avoid generating questions that have been asked before
- Enhanced fallback question diversity with multiple options
- Updated question generation prompt to explicitly avoid repetition

## Testing Results

### Comprehensive Test Suite Created
- ‚úÖ `test_fixes.py` - Verification script for all fixes
- ‚úÖ All 4 test categories passed:
  1. Review node async fix
  2. Question generation with history check  
  3. Question log parsing
  4. Full workflow setup

### Core Functionality Verified
- ‚úÖ Graph creation and compilation works
- ‚úÖ Router correctly directs to learn/review modes
- ‚úÖ State management preserves data correctly
- ‚úÖ Question generation avoids duplicates
- ‚úÖ Review mode works without async errors
- ‚úÖ File I/O operations (logs, embeddings) function properly

## File Changes Made

### Modified Files:
1. **`agents/nodes/review_node.py`**
   - Fixed async chain syntax
   - Now uses direct `ainvoke()` call

2. **`agents/nodes/generate_questions.py`**
   - Added question history checking
   - Improved fallback question diversity
   - Enhanced context building with previous questions

3. **`prompts/question_generation_prompt.py`**
   - Updated prompt to explicitly avoid repetition
   - Added guidance for generating diverse questions

4. **`requirements.txt`**
   - Added pytest and pytest-asyncio for testing

### Test Files Created:
- `test_fixes.py` - Comprehensive fix verification
- (Previous test files were removed/undone by user)

## Current System Status

### ‚úÖ Working Features:
- Learn mode with document retrieval and question generation
- Review mode with past question analysis
- Question and answer logging
- Answer embedding and storage
- Feedback generation
- State management across workflow
- Router logic for mode selection

### üîç Data Flow Verified:
1. **Learn Mode**: Router ‚Üí Document Retrieval ‚Üí Question Generation ‚Üí User Interaction ‚Üí Feedback ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Embedding
2. **Review Mode**: Router ‚Üí Question Log Analysis ‚Üí Review Question Generation ‚Üí User Interaction
3. **Storage**: Questions and answers properly logged to `logs/` directory
4. **Embeddings**: User answers embedded and stored in `embeddings/user_answers/`

### üìä Current Data State:
- Question log contains 2 past questions (test, langchain concepts)
- Answer log contains 3 past answers with feedback
- Embeddings directory populated with user answer vectors
- All storage mechanisms functioning correctly

## Next Steps

The system is now ready for full production use. Both critical issues have been resolved:
1. ‚úÖ Review mode works without errors
2. ‚úÖ Question generation avoids repetition and creates diverse questions

Users can now:
- Run `python -m main` to start interactive sessions
- Use both 'learn' and 'review' modes successfully
- Get diverse, non-repetitive questions
- Have their progress properly tracked and stored
